# SDL2 using Rust

Game tutorials for SDL2 using Rust

## Reason

This is great way to learn Rust and also to program games. I am using SDL2 instead of other engines such as Bevy as this will allow me to implement more features and/or functionality instead of already (almost at the time of writing) completed framework. The games will all use a common 'game framework' library to be able to allow for more game types to be supported. 3rd party crates will be used where appropriate but possibly hidden behind crate features in the game library.
